# AI-Pose-Estimation-with-Python-and-MediaPipe
A real-time body pose estimation and bicep curl counter built with Python, OpenCV, and the 2026 MediaPipe Tasks API. This project uses machine learning to detect 33 skeletal landmarks and calculate joint angles for fitness monitoring


This project implements a robust pose estimation system using the latest **MediaPipe Tasks API (2026)**. It captures live video from a webcam, detects 33 human body landmarks in real-time, and provides a foundation for fitness tracking applications like rep counting and form analysis.



##  Features
* **Future-Proof API**: Built using `mediapipe.tasks.vision`, avoiding the deprecated `mp.solutions` modules.
* **Real-Time Detection**: Optimized for high-frequency video processing with asynchronous-ready logic.
* **Custom Visualization**: Manual landmark rendering using OpenCV for better performance and style control.
* **Angle Calculation**: Built-in logic to measure joint angles (e.g., elbows, knees) for activity monitoring.
